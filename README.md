Miscellaneous patches and files

sunxifb-performance-tests gives some detail on performance improvements implemented
by the various-optimizations branch of the forked xf86-video-sunxi repository using
benchmarks such as x11perf.

benchimagemark.tar.gz is a slightly modified version of a program I found
on the web to measure off-screen to screen copy throughput using various methods
(xPutImage, xShmPutImage, shared memory pixmaps).
